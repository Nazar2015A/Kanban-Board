The project includes columns for adding tasks, and each column
                  allows you to add tasks for task management. Each column is
                  draggable and droppable, meaning you can change their order.
                  Additionally, each task can be moved within the task list and
                  across columns. All columns and tasks are stored in local
                  storage, which means that when the page is reloaded, all data
                  will be preserved
